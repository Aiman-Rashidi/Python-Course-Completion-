set1 = {8, 7, 12, "Harry", [1, 2]}  #Sets in Python can only contain hashable (immutable) objects.

# print(set1)

# as the set1 cant be accessed by indexing hence list values cant be updated \






# Answer
# You canâ€™t add a list to a set because lists are mutable and unhashable, so the set creation fails.
# Even if valid, set items can't be accessed or changed by index because sets are unordered and don't support indexing.
